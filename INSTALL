We are planning to move to CMake in the near future. In the meantime, to build
MGmol, you need to add the first 3 letters of the name of your local platform
in install/Makefile.in. Then add a file install/MakeXXX.inc (where XXX are 3
letters used to identify your platform in install/Makefile.in with the proper
paths to the libraries needed. Look at the examples already there.
Once this is done, simply type 'make' in the main directory
or the 'src' directory. Type 'make debug' to build teh debug version.
