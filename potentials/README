Pseudopotentials used by MGmol are not fundamentally different than other
norm conserving pseudopotentials. They are just in a different format.
Pseudopotentials in this subdirectory have typically been adapted from
pseudopotentials generated for other Plane Waves codes.

Pseudopotentials with names containing "ONCV" refer to Optimized
norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials as described in:

Pseudopotentials with names containing "SG15" have been adapted from the Qbox
code (http://www.quantum-simulation.org). Their generation id described in
the following paper:
